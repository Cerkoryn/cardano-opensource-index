# cardano-opensource-index

Some dishonourable mentions:
- *Liqwid* advertises as "DeFi" (decentralised finance) despite not open-sourcing their main protocol contracts.
- *VyFi* to my knowledge operates as DeX but has not open-sourced ther main contracts. 
- *Optim* calls itself "decentralization advocates" despite not open-sourcing their main protocol contracts.
- *WingRiders* are probably the biggest scumbags on Cardano. Also closed source "DeX".
- *SundaeSwap* says they build "decentralized software" however do not meet the most basic tenant of decentralisation, making their main protocol smart contracts open-source.

note: Sundae & Liqwid Labs both make significant OS contributions however it is a smudge against them that they do not open-source their protocol smart contracts.

Some honourable mentions:
- *Indigo* is a fully-fledged protocol, and one of the largest which is also completely open-source.
- *LenFi* v1 has been open-source and has already open-sourced v2 before launch.
- *Spectrum-Finance* (soon to be splash) is probably the only DeX which is actually decentralised.
- *Danogo* is a cool project, would like to see more bonds some day.
